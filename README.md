# AVWTime
AVWTime is an android hour tracking app for independent contractors. 

The actual phone application connects to a middle-tier server connected to the database, which processes and returns the results to the phone.

It is able to be used either with constant access to internet or while the user is out and about with no internet or data connection, as their changes will be uploaded when they return get internet access again.

#Reading Delphi
Delphi is an IDE with a visual form designer, so without actually owning Delphi and being able to open the project it can be a bit hard to read. The .pas files are the main code parts, though they often rely on objects in the forms, defined in the .fmx files.

This code won't actually work properly and no executables are supplied because the database, server, and connections between all the different parts (database, server, and client) are all not properly set up in this because the information used for that is private. However otherwise all the code is the same as what is running in the video demo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpW11qppOY)
